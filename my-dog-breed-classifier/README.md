# Building A Dog Breed Classifier using Deep Learning

Currently I'm following the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree at Udacity.
In this context, I'm working on a capstone project. The purpose of this project is to build an algorithm that is able to detect & classify automatically the dog breed from a picture. This repo is therefore the repo of my Capstone Project.

Here is the original repo from Udacity : **(https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/tree/master/project-dog-classification)**

Below is a project overview & some instructions

## Project Overview

 In this project, I learned how to build a pipeline that can be used within a web or mobile app to process real-world, user-supplied images.  Given an image of a dog, my algorithm is able to identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed.  If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.

Along with exploring state-of-the-art CNN models for classification and localization, I made important design decisions about the user experience for your app.  The initial goal was that by completing this lab, I understand the challenges involved in piecing together a series of models designed to perform various tasks in a data processing pipeline.  Each model has its strengths and weaknesses, and engineering a real-world application often involves solving many problems without a perfect answer.  Even a imperfect solution will nonetheless create a fun user experience!


## Project Instructions

### Instructions

1. Clone the Udacity's initial repository and navigate to the downloaded folder.
	
	```	
		git clone https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch.git
		cd deep-learning-v2-pytorch/project-dog-classification
	```
    
__NOTE:__ if you are using the Udacity workspace, you *DO NOT* need to re-download the datasets in steps 2 and 3 - they can be found in the `/data` folder as noted within the workspace Jupyter notebook.

2. Download the [dog dataset](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/dogImages.zip).  Unzip the folder and place it in the repo, at location `path/to/dog-project/dogImages`.  The `dogImages/` folder should contain 133 folders, each corresponding to a different dog breed.
3. Download the [human dataset](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/lfw.tgz).  Unzip the folder and place it in the repo, at location `path/to/dog-project/lfw`.  If you are using a Windows machine, you are encouraged to use [7zip](http://www.7-zip.org/) to extract the folder. 
4. Make sure you have already installed the necessary Python packages according to the README in the program repository.
5. Open a terminal window and navigate to the project folder. Open the notebook and follow the instructions.
	
	```
		jupyter notebook dog_app.ipynb
	```

__NOTE:__ While some code has already been implemented to get you started, you will need to implement additional functionality to successfully answer all of the questions included in the notebook. __Unless requested, do not modify code that has already been included.__

__NOTE:__ In the notebook, you will need to train CNNs in PyTorch.  If your CNN is taking too long to train, feel free to pursue one of the options under the section __Accelerating the Training Process__ below.



## (Optionally) Accelerating the Training Process 

If your code is taking too long to run, you will need to either reduce the complexity of your chosen CNN architecture or switch to running your code on a GPU.  If you'd like to use a GPU, you can spin up an instance of your own:

## My Implementations

I built 2 convolutional neural networks (CNN) to predict & classify dog breed from images.

### CNN from scratch
I started to build a first convolutional neural network from scratch based on the following architecture : 

Net(
  (cnn_layers): Sequential(
    (0): Conv2d(3, 32, kernel_size=(3, 3), stride=(2, 2), padding=(1, 1))
    (1): ReLU(inplace)
    (2): BatchNorm2d(32, eps=1e-05, momentum=0.1, affine=True, track_running_stats=True)
    (3): MaxPool2d(kernel_size=2, stride=2, padding=0, dilation=1, ceil_mode=False)
    (4): Dropout(p=0.25)
    (5): Conv2d(32, 64, kernel_size=(3, 3), stride=(2, 2), padding=(1, 1))
    (6): ReLU(inplace)
    (7): BatchNorm2d(64, eps=1e-05, momentum=0.1, affine=True, track_running_stats=True)
    (8): MaxPool2d(kernel_size=2, stride=2, padding=0, dilation=1, ceil_mode=False)
    (9): Dropout(p=0.25)
    (10): Conv2d(64, 128, kernel_size=(3, 3), stride=(1, 1), padding=(1, 1))
    (11): ReLU(inplace)
    (12): BatchNorm2d(128, eps=1e-05, momentum=0.1, affine=True, track_running_stats=True)
    (13): MaxPool2d(kernel_size=2, stride=2, padding=0, dilation=1, ceil_mode=False)
    (14): Dropout(p=0.25)
  )
  (linear_layers): Sequential(
    (0): Linear(in_features=6272, out_features=500, bias=True)
    (1): ReLU(inplace)
    (2): Dropout(p=0.5)
    (3): Linear(in_features=500, out_features=133, bias=True)
  )
)

But as expected, accuracy was low **26%** after a training of **50 epochs**.


### CNN with transfer learning (Resnet50)
I then modified my strategy and I decided to used transfer learning to create a new CNN that can identify dog breed from images. I used one of the most efficient models on the image classification task, which is called Resnet50.
I only modified the last layers to adapt the architecture to our classification task of 133 classes. 

As expected, the performance of this last version of my CNN performed very well (**88% accuracy**), even with training of **20 epochs**.
